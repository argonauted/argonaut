Changes to make the react example work:

1) tsconfig - add the jsx line. The following setting does full conversion of react

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es6", "dom", "scripthost"],
    "stripInternal": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "strict": true,
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "es2020",
    "newLine": "lf",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "jsx": "react"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts","types/*.ts"],
}

2) CellDisplay.tsx file prints out the same result as I am currently showing

3) dev dependencies added 

	"@types/react": "^18.0.27",
	"@types/react-dom": "^18.0.10",

4) dependencies added

    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
